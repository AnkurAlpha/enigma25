## Prizes Component
This component requires GSAP Scrolltrigger and ThreeJS to work. When the user scrolls in, the first trophy rotates and the text fades in. Then from behind the 1st trophy, the second trophy goes to the left. Then, the third trophy behind the first trophy goes to the right. This first happens for the first trophy and then the second trophy and then the third trophy.

## Marketing / Content Component
This component requires Horizantal scrollable content component, including the images and text. It should also include a text masking effect. The text should be masked by the image and should be revealed as the user scrolls.
